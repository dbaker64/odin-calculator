# preliminary comments
I'm writing these before I get into this project. I think this project will be a lot of fun, while also giving me a chance to work on my skills in all 3 languages. I anticipate many challenges, but I am confident I can overcome them. Below I will be outlining what I need to do in algorithm/pseudo-code/just notes for myself. Wish me luck!

# planning
create functions to add subtract multiply and divide two numbers
create variables for operand1, operator, and operand2
get values for op1, opr, and op2
create function operate that will call another function based on what operation was passed into it
create html calculator with buttons for each digit and buttons for each operator
create clear button and display for the calculator
create function to populate display when buttons are clicked
create variable to store display value
create way to update display with the solution, possibly same function, not sure
